### About Me 

Recently, I am an undergraduate student at [CMU School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu). My research focuses on topics in [robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu). I am interested in problems that arise when robots are trying to solve problems by applying their knowledge for one problem to a similar problem, such as transfer learning, and abstracting the underlying model of a scene, such as [physical reasoning](https://phyre.ai), which can also prevent the robot from performing the same error again. Ultimately, we can achieve some kind of [knowledge-based systems (KBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems) so that the robot can have a knowledge base to solve real, complex problems. 

Besides that, I also dream to build a virtual platform for robotics. To that end, I am widely interested in topics in Game AI and training intelligent agents. I envision a future where virtual reality becomes common and human can interact with robots over virtual platforms. 


### Research 

I'm interested in, but not limited to, the following topics: 
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Abstraction and Reasoning 
- Game AI (_Unity_)

I was fortunate to work with [Tesca Fitzgerald](https://www.tescafitzgerald.com) supervised by [Henny Admoni](http://hennyadmoni.com) in the [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu).
