### About Me 

Recently, I am an undergraduate student at [CMU School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu). My research focuses on topics in [robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu). I am interested in problems that arise when robots are trying to apply their knowledge to solve real, complex problems, such as [physical reasoning](https://phyre.ai), computational creativity, trial-and-error learning, and transfer learning. Besides that, I am also widely interested in topics in Game AI and training intelligent agents.

I dream to enable robots in virtual reality to interact and serve humans in the future. 

### Research 

I'm interested in, but not limited to, the following topics: 
- Reinforcement Learning
- Physical Reasoning 
- Computer Vision 
- Game AI 

I am fortunate to work with [Tesca Fitzgerald](https://www.tescafitzgerald.com) in the [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu), supervised by [Henny Admoni](http://hennyadmoni.com). 

Recently, I also join and work with [Christopher Atkeson](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/) at CMU. 

### Academics 

Coursework in progress: 
> [Probability and Computing (15-259)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/PnC/class.html) \
> [Intro to Deep Learning (11-785, PhD)](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S21/index.html) \
> [Constructive Logic (15-317)](http://symbolaris.com/course/constlog.html) \
> [MultiModal Machine Learning (11-777, Audit)](https://cmu-multicomp-lab.github.io/mmml-course/fall2020/) 

_Cumulative QPA: 4.0/4.0_

### Skills 
The programming languages I am familiar with are Python, C/C++, C#, SML, Java, Arduino, MATLAB. \
The tools that I am familiar with are OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras, Numpy, Tensorflow, ROS, Git, Mathematica. \
For natural languages, I can speak English, Mandarin, and a little Japanese. 

### Trivia
My cute profile picture is actually [Inaba Kumori](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNElM45JypxqAR73RoUQ10g). \
I enjoy all kinds of J-pop and J-rock. In particular, my favorite bands are _Sakanaction_ and _Ling Tosite Sigure_. \
I like seas, sunset, and movies. AND CATS !!!
