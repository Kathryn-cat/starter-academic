### About Me 

Recently, I am an undergraduate student at [CMU School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu). My research focuses on topics in [robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu). I am interested in problems that arise when robots are trying to use their own knowledge to solve problems, such as [knowledge-based systems (KBS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems) and [physical reasoning](https://phyre.ai). 

My life goal is to give robots real intelligence and build a virtual platform for robotics. 


### Research 

I'm interested in, but not limited to, the following topics: 
- Knowledge-based Systems
- Game AI 
- Abstraction and Reasoning 
- Transfer Learning 

In the past, I was fortunate to work with [Tesca Fitzgerald](https://www.tescafitzgerald.com) in the [HARP Lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu) on transfer learning, supervised by [Henny Admoni](http://hennyadmoni.com).
