I am an undergraduate student at CMU School of Computer Science. My research focuses on topics in robotics. I am interested in problems that arise when robots are trying to use their own knowledge to solve problems, such as knowledge-based systems (KBS) and physical reasoning. My life goal is to give robots real intelligence and build a virtual platform for robotics.
